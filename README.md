# tn-carto Project

This is a web project for integrating with Carto for geo-visualization.  Currently this covers targeting.

## Development

Running the web server is not necessary to do development here.  Just running the index.html in your web browser is
what you should do when testing mapping/integration changes with Carto.

If you want to test the web server functionality.

Just run:

`python application.py`
